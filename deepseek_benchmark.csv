It concludes that the traditional practice of clearing government-held spectrum of Federal users and auctioning it for commercial use is not sustainable. In light of changes made possible by modern technology, the report recommends that the U.S. government share underutilized spectrum to the maximum extent consistent with the Federal mission, and requires the Secretary of Commerce to identify 1,000 MHz of Federal spectrum in which to implement shared-use spectrum pilot projects., The document discusses the challenges and recommendations for Federal spectrum policy, emphasizing the need for sharing underutilized Federal spectrum to maximize its use without disrupting Federal missions. It highlights the inefficiency of the current spectrum management system and proposes a new architecture for spectrum sharing that could significantly increase the effective capacity of spectrum. The recommendations include the establishment of a Federal Spectrum Access System (SAS) and the identification of 1,000 MHz of Federal spectrum for shared use., The report proposes a major evolution of existing spectrum management practices to share underutilized Federal spectrum, aiming to spur economic growth by creating shared-use spectrum superhighways. It recommends immediate actions, including the sharing of new low-power civil devices in Federal bands, the creation of a Spectrum Sharing Partnership Steering Committee, and the establishment of an urban Test City for spectrum management experimentation.

Government can nonetheless play an important role by supplementing and complementing those forces. Technology policy is not something that, once set in place, remains immutable. Broad principles exist, but effective technology policy requires sufficient flexibility to permit response to changing national and international situations., The document outlines various programs and initiatives aimed at implementing U.S. technology policy, including incentives for private sector innovation, education and training improvements, and international cooperation in science and technology. It details proposed fiscal year 1991 budget levels for these programs, efforts to protect intellectual property, and reforms in federal procurement and product liability laws., The document outlines various federal programs aimed at enhancing education, research, and development across multiple sectors including mathematics and science education, adult education, graduate training, and technology development. It details proposed budgets for Fiscal Year 1991, highlighting increases in R&D funding, support for advanced technologies, biotechnology, transportation, energy, and industrial productivity. It also mentions efforts to transfer federally funded technology to private industry and federal-state activities to support local initiatives., The centers offer clients access to a national data bank that includes over 100 million documents of accumulated technical knowledge, along with their expertise in retrieving information and applying it in support of clients' needs. The centers are backed by state-sponsored business or technical centers that provide access to the technology transfer network. The centers provide trade-impacted small and medium-sized manufacturers with in-depth technical assistance.","English, English, English, English, English, English",WHITE HOUSE STAFFING MEMORANDUM,12 / 12 / 90,Null,"Education in Science and Mathematics, Technology and the American Standard of Living, U.S. Technology Policy, Education, Science and Mathematics, National Education Goals, Educational Reform, Federal Government Role, Technology, Standard of Living, Federal Government, Manufacturing, Basic Research, Technology Policy, Manufacturing, Science and Technology, Economic Growth, Standard of Living, Technology Policy, Private Sector Innovation, Education and Training, International Cooperation, Intellectual Property, Federal Procurement, Product Liability Laws, Education, Research and Development, Technology, Science, Mathematics, Adult Education, Graduate Training, Biotechnology, Transportation, Energy, Industrial Productivity",Memorandum,Null
